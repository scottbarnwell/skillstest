IT Help Desk Request Analysis
=====

##The Problem

Like many IT departments, the City of Asheville uses a Help Desk system to track and manage the many requests for service that come in every day. Requests cover a wide range of issues including password reset requests, new hardware requests, notifications of inoperable tools or websites, software bugs, training requests, and much more. In all, technicians and analysts respond to thousands of requests for service each year. We know the importance of working smarter and identifying opportunities for automation. To that end, we would like to analyze the history of Help Desk requests, idenitfy patterns, and see if we can learn a thing or two that will help us work better and smarter. Think about the analysis as well as relevant visualizations to communicate your findings.

##Data 

* Help Desk request data is stored in a .csv file and can be found here:  
* Associated metadata can be found here:

##Rules

Keep it simple. We are not looking for a finished product, but instead think "minimal"... something that could start us down the path of awesome.  

* You may use any resources or tools that you like.  
* However, the actual work should be done by you.
* You can ask us questions - We prefer you use this repo's issues as the communications to do it. (Email is also fine)

##Submissions

We really prefer to get submissions via GitHub. If you deliver visualizations, consider using Github pages. But if you have other ways of working, that's fine. Just be sure the your work is freely available and accessible on the web.

**Please complete your submission by Friday, October 16th, at 9am.** Early submissions are welcome!
